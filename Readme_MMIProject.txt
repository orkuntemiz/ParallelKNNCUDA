1. All the codes are available in https://github.com/orkuntemiz/knncuda
2. To use the implementation in python just open and execute the codes in MMIProject.ipynb
3. The project and solution repository is MMIProject.
4. For the python implementation I used Global & Shared Memory Implementation which is the best performing one. Therefore I call it in knncuda.cpp file. Which is a python wrapper for CUDA code.
5. I forked the python wrapper respository from the DylanWusee and change the necessary parts.
6. Enjoy!
